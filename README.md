### Credits

I highly recommend [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com). The dictionary has up-to-date words, explanations, and etymologies. Also on the website you can find games, common mistakes and examples. Sometimes I like to spend time just browsing ðŸ˜„ Merriam-Webster website allows to display, reproduce, print or download their content for personal, non-commercial use.

Also I have used information from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki). An internet resource that is treated with special favor by a lot of people including me. It allows users to share, reuse, edit and [etc.](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en) articles.
